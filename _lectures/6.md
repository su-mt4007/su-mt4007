## Summary

In this lecture, we are discussing joins. Joining tables allow us to combine
different sources of data into a single dataframe. As a data scientist, you will
this happens more often than not. As mentioned previously, data is never nice
and in the form we want to work with, in most cases it is scattered over
multiple data sources, for instance, databases, the internet, experimental data
etc. Joining enables us to combine many datasets into a single one.

## Joins

Join is the operation of combining different tables into a single table. There
are many different types of joins that are relevant an each has the effect of
mutating the table to increase or decrease the number of variables in the final
table. The 4 most common merges we will encounter are `left join`, `right join`,
`inner join` and `outer join` each serving a distinct rule for combining the
tables. The following image illustrates these operations.

Here, we are always working refereing to combining *two* tables. In the case
where there are many more tables to be combined, we can split it up into
combining two tables at a time. 

The most common way to work is to iteratively expand a dataset by combining
other datasets. That is why, we will work `left join` a lot. Nevertheless,
combining the other methods enable us to create more complex combinations of
datasets.

Learning how to join tables naturally allows us to work with SQL type databases.
Joins are essential, when working SQL, since storing data efficently involves
splitting data up into different tables in a certain way. We will discuss more
about this in the comming lecture.
