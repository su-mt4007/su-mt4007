# Course Information

The course gives an introduction to obtaining, transforming, exploring and
visualising data using modern tools which is at the core of datascience.

We will specifically be using the following tools: `Python`/`R` for programming,
`Jupyter notebook` for analysing data, `Git` together with `Github` for version
controll. This course will give and introduction to these tools and how they are
used in Data Science.

An important aspect of data science and science in general is
[reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). There will be
a great emphasis on creating reproducable code and reports. The tools mentioned
above will be used for this. 

This course is naturally designed for self-study. Each week there will be course
material that you should read up on. We will not have traditional lectures in
this course. Rather, we will meet in person once a week, where I will give a
live demo of the material gone through the week before. In previous itterations of the
course, the live demos have been very appreciated. After the live demo I will be
available until 17.00 for help with assignments or questions. In addition, I
will be available on Fridays between 13-16 via Zoom for questions.

The main literature of the course will be 
- [R for Data
Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) by Grolemund and Wickham which is specific to R.
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Wes McKinney which is for Python. 

Both have an open access version, which are accessed through the links above.
You can buy the books if you want but most of the information can be found on
the web!

The teacher of the course is [Taariq Nazar](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/tana2011-1.618737).

Finally, we should give credit where it is due. **This course is based on ideas
& material developed by Martin Sköld, Erik Thorsén, Michael Höhle and Felix
Günther**.
