## Summary 

In this lecture we will learn how to visualise data in terms of plots. We will
also look into the differences between plots and how to choose a suitable
visualisation method for a specific problem. Finally, we will conclude with and
example. This lecture will contain a less content than others.

## Visualising Data

A ~~picture~~ *plot* is worth a thousand word, is a popular phrase, that conveys
the use the power of data visualisation. This is meant to convey the message
that you can understand more from a single image than a text of words. In our
case, when we analyse plots generated from the data we will be able to draw
deeper conclusions than we would have by just looking at the data through
tables. So far that is what we have been doing. Although tables of data are
great for, initial interpretation, transformation e.t.c, it lends us no way of
understanding the data. Visualising data in forms of images(plots), gives us a
tool to analyse the data and gain a deeper understanding of it, it enables us,
in most cases, to draw far deeper conclusion of the data than would be possible
otherwise.

### Chosing the right Plot

There are many ways to represent the data, but one has to be mindfull of the
type of plot used. Choosing the right plot is an important problem we will be
faced with when visualising data. The plot should convey a conclusion that can
be drawn without ambiguity. That is why it is important to consistently use
propper labeling and descriptive captions. Seeing an image without context or
understanding will render the image uninterpretable, and in cases, lead the
viewer to draw the wrong conclusion. 

### Examples of plots 

Let's begin by creating a simple
plot of a `sin` function. We are not able to plot a continous line chart, we
need to provide a set of data points $\{(x_n,y_n)\}_{n \geq 1}$. Therefore, we
need to discretize the x-axis to be able to plot a function.

We can do this in the following way 

:::code-group
```Python
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

n_steps = 1000 # Size of partition of the x-axis
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, n_step) 
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("sin(x)")
plt.title("Line Chart of sin function")
plt.show()
```

```R 
n_steps = 1000
x <- seq(0, 2*pi, 1/n_steps)
y <- sin(x)

// Here it is always easier to work with dfs
df <- tibble(x=x,y=y)
df %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_path(mapping=aes(x=x, y=y)) +
    labs(title="Line Chart of sin function",
         x="x",
         y="sin(x)")
```

Since we want to be working with Dataframes, it would be nice to directly visualise
data from them. Thankfully, this a feature that has support in both
Python and R. To show a simple example of this we can use the
`Winter_medals2022-11-03.csv` data. 

We can visualise the number of medals won by the 3 countries with the highest
number of total medals in the following way

:::code-group
```Python
# Process data
df = pd.read_csv("./data/Winter_medals2022-11-03.csv")
top3 = df[["Country", "Total"]].groupby("Country").sum().sort_values("Total", ascending=False).head(3).index
df = df.loc[df["Country"].isin(top3)][["Country", "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze"]].groupby("Country").sum()

# Plot data, use stacked to get nicer plot.
df.plot.barh(stacked=True)
```

```R
df <- read_csv("./data/Winter_medals2022-11-03.csv")
top3 <- df %>%
        group_by(Country) %>%
        summarise(Gold=sum(Gold)) %>%
        arrange(desc(Gold)) %>%
        select(Country) %>%
        head(3)

df <- df %>% 
    filter(Country %in% top3$Country ) %>%
    group_by(Country) %>%
    summarise(Gold = sum(Gold), Silver = sum(Silver), Bronze = sum(Bronze))

df %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -Country, names_to = "Medal", values_to = "Count") %>% # We will go through pivoting in a few lectures
    ggplot(aes(x = Count, y = Country, fill = Medal)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    labs(x = "Medals", y = "Country")
```

This is by no means comprehensive, but is meant to show you how to plot in
practice. You can find more examples in the provided reading material. We will
explore how to use plots to draw conclusions in the next plot.
