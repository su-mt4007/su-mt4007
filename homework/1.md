# Homework 1

## Overview


In this assignment you will initialize a github repo on the course github
organisation where you will put all future assignments and projects in and you will create
your first project and `push` it to github (uploading in github terms). 
All future homework will be reported in `Markdown`, which is a simple
markup language. It will make it easy for you to write and present work on
Github since Github has a builtin Markdown parser.

If you are stuck, GOOGLE it! There is plenty of information on the web.

The instructions to solve this homework can is contained in [week
1](/lectures/week-1) of the course material.

To summarise:

- Initialize github repo
- Create a simple report for the homework
- Peer review of a classmates homework

## Assigment
### Connecting to the Github repository

1. Create a github repository under your account: Open the Github Desktop
   application. Create a new repository and name it `su-mt4007`. Save it
   somewhere easily accessible on your computer.

2. Now go to your created repo in your local repository create a subfolder named `HW1`.

3.  Inside the `HW1` subfolder, create a markdown file. Name it `README.md` containing
  - A brief description of yourself. 
  - A brief description of your previous experience with Data Science.
4. Now, on the Github Desktop app you can **Commit** and then **Push** your
   changes to your github repository. You can find information [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop)
   about how to do that. You will be able to see the changes you have made on
   your repository on [Github](github.com).

5. When you are happy with the result, possibly after repeated uses of Commit and Push, open an issue in your repository (see image below where to find issues) stating “HW1 ready for grading!”.

### Peer Review

After deadline has passed, go to the repository of your assigned partner and
give feedback under the issue they have raised. You should provide feedback by
responding to the “HW1 ready for grading!” issue. Copy the following checklist
and use it in your review:

* Is the homework complete, e.g. are all steps in the homework done?
* Is there a working link from the main repository `README.md` to `HW1.md`?
* Do figures show up on `HW1.md` as expected?
